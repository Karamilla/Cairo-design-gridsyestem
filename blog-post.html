            <strong>Muhammed mustafa</strong> is an Arts Student at
            <em>Cairo University of the Arts</em>. Born in Egypt, he has lived
            in New York extensively but recently returned to his home country to
            teach his passion. he loves walking around hidden backstreets
            discovering quirky shops and random art.

            In al-Darb al-Ahmar, the only foreign faces I see are young Muslims
            from Indonesia. They are attending the nearby al-Azhar University.
            Most western tourists currently avoid Cairo due to security
            concerns; there have been attacks on Egypt’s Christian minority in
            recent years. Walking around the neighbourhood, however, I feel
            safe. Countless old men, seated at the qahwa where they drink
            glasses of coffee or tea, welcome me with the words “Ahlan wa
            Sahlan”.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            The fascinating thing is that Cairo has managed to sustain all these
            different entities. This is the magic and wonder of the city

            I hope that more and more people will see the true beauty of Egypt
            soon. It is a captivating beast that you won't be able to take your
            eyes of again. Explore the city in your own pace and
            <u>discover things you have never seen before</u>.
